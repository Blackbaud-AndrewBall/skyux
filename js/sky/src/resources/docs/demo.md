summary: The resources constant and filter are available to localize SKY UX components.

The resources constant and filter allow you to localize SKY UX components. `bbResources` mostly applies for component development.  When you build SKY UX and need to render a string, you can inject the `bbResources` constant. When you inject `bbResources` all locale strings are available on the `bbResources` object and in a `bbResources` filter.
